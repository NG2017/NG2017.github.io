  <div class="intro">
    Iceland is one of the world’s most incredible destinations, largely due to it’s jaw-dropping natural landscape. It has everything from lava ﬁelds to glaciers. It’s a dream destination if you love the great outdoors and exploring everything that nature has to offer. However, planning a tour of Iceland and organizing the logistics by yourself can quickly turn into a nightmare, as you’ll have loads of questions about how to get the best out of your vacation.

    <h3>Overwhelming Questions</h3>
    <p>Some of your questions might include: How can you possibly decide what’s worth seeing when there are so many
      things to choose from like volcanos, geysers, waterfalls, hot water springs, basalt columns, huge crevices,
      glaciers, lagunes, and mud pools, and when several months wouldn’t be enough to see it all?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="list_container">
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Once you do have a rough itinerary, how can it be arranged so that it doesn’t cost an arm and a leg?</li>
      <li>Where should you book your stay and what should you eat in a country where a bed in a hostel can cost 100
        euros a night?</li>
      <li>What is the best time of year to go so the inclement weather doesn’t ruin your plans?</li>
      <li>Is it better to go in winter when it’s cold and dark, or in summer when it’s light for 20 hours each day?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="article2_container">
    <h3>BTS Has the Answers</h3>
    <p>Beyond the Standard’s answers to these tricky questions is two campervan tours of Iceland; one in the winter, one
      in summer. Each tour is organized by local Icelandic tour guides who jam pack the tour with both the absolute
      must-see sights and hidden gems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article3_container">
    <p>The campervan is a transformed mini bus with heating, a table, chairs, a basic kitchen, a bed and bedding. By
      going with a campervan, you’ll get the spontaneity and adventure of backpacking, while also enjoying the comfort
      of a hotel stay. There’s always a place you can escape to when you need a moment, and you’ll have a warm bed to
      sleep in at the end of a long and exciting day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article4_container">
    <p>It’s important to be flexible when touring Iceland. Your tour guides will keep an eye on the weather forecasts,
      and things can always be adapted if rain clouds make the existing plan tricky. In a country where it rains almost
      every day, the best kind of tour is one that can escape the clouds at a moment's notice. By keeping an eye on the
      weather and trying to steer clear of clouds, we have the best chance of seeing the northern lights during the
      winter tour.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article5_container">
    <p>In Iceland, forward thinking and planning is super important, when it comes to keeping the reins on our budget
      too. One of the ways we keep the cost of our tour affordable, is by shopping for local ingredients together and
      cooking meals on our campervan’s grill.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article6_container">
    <p>Surprisingly, there are some things in Iceland, which are actually cheaper than in other parts of the world.
      These include world-class lamb hearts, cod, crustaceans, lamb, and beef. Forget that old stereotype of fermented
      shark meat!</p>

      <h3>D1 — Arrival, hot river, and lava tunnel (100 km)</h3>
      <div class="szoveg">
        <p>
          Arriving at Keflavík airport, we’ll pick up our campervans. Then we’ll travel to the
          island’s south western
          corner to Hveragerði. Here we’ll check out the bubbling hot springs, and enjoy an excursion to the
          boiling
          lake where you can also bathe if you wish. Nearby, we’ll visit a lava tunnel, which is several thousands
          of
          years old. If you’re brave enough you can even climb inside.

      <h3>D2 — Geysers, waterfalls, and natural baths (230 km)</h3>
      <div class="szoveg">
        <p>
          Iceland’s most famous sight has got to be Geysir, after which geysers got their name.
          Gullfoss is the most
          famous of Iceland’s waterfalls, and after visiting it, we’ll explore another waterfall called Skógafoss
          from
          above, underneath, outside, and inside. We’ll actually spend tonight at the foot of this waterfall. For
          those who still have energy to burn, we’ll visit the outdoor swimming pool at Seljavallalaug, which is
          half
          natural and half man-made.

          First up, we’ll visit the beautiful black basalt columns at Reynisfjara, which is
          situated on an impressive
          black sandy beach. Then, we’ll visit a stunning canyon before spending the night at Skaftafell at the
          foot
          of the Vatnajökull glacier.

          In the morning we’ll climb up a hill and look out to see how icebergs and ice walls
          separate from the
          glacier and float out into the ocean. In what promises to be a magical moment, seals will play all
          around
          us. We’ll spend the evening in a small town called Höfn, where they serve the best lobster in all of
          Iceland. There’s also a great pool in Höfn where we can soak in the warm water or zip down water slides.

          We’ll drive a lot, but the upside is that we’ll travel along the most beautiful scenic
          route available.
          We’ll pass fewer and fewer cars as we head to the north-west of the island. We’ll stop by a fishing
          village
          on the banks of a fjord, which would actually be the perfect set for a Wes Anderson film. We’ll spend
          the
          night right up north, on the banks of the Myvatn lake. If we’re lucky and it’s a clear night, we’ll be
          able
          to see the northern lights, too.

        <p>
          Before we go swimming in what could be one of Iceland’s most beautifully bright blue
          thermal baths, we’ll
          visit an incredibly active geothermal display, full of bubbling mud pots and steam rising from the
          earth.
          Here at Hverirt we’ll also visit a lava field and the world's largest geothermal power plant. We’ll
          spend
          the night in Akureyri, which is Iceland's second biggest city. Tonight we’ll sleep not in our campervan
          but
          in a capsule hotel, which you might recognize if you’re into Japanese sci-fi.
